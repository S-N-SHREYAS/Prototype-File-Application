# Prototype-File-Application

The application aims to provide a solution for creating an activity with interactive elements such as a Text box, Save button, Open button, and Create button. The objective is to enable the user to write and save text, as well as retrieve and display previously saved text files.
The program follows the following functionality:
• The user can input text into the Text box.
• Pressing the Create button will save the entered text as a text file in MkSDcard.
• Subsequent changes to the text can be saved by pressing the Save button, which updates the existing file with the latest content.
• Pressing the Open button allows the user to retrieve and display the contents from the previously saved files in the Text box.
• If the user attempts to save the contents in the Textbox to a file without creating it first, a toast message will be displayed, notifying the user to "First Create a File."
• Pressing the Delete button will delete the file with the filename provided.
• The application also displays relevant toast messages in response to successful operations and errors that arise
By implementing these features, the program provides a user-friendly interface for creating, saving, opening, and managing text files within the application.
